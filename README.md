Welcome to my first GitHub project!

In this repository, I have used a Random Forest model with Decision Trees to predict customer churn (i.e., customers leaving the service) for a telecommunications company. Although this is a common type of project, it has been a great learning experience for me in understanding machine learning fundamentals and ensemble methods.

Please note that there might be errors or areas that need improvement in my work. I would greatly appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or corrections you may have. Your input will help me grow and continue learning.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project, and feel free to explore and research more about similar approaches!

Happy coding!
